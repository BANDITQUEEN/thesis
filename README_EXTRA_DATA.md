# thesis
In the project "Thesis" you can find the source code for the Scraping, Analyzing and the Classification of greek fake news and the data you need to run the code. 
You don't need to run the Scraping and Analyzing codes, you can find every output inside the github file
The only output data you need to run the final FINAL_test_ClassificationLR_DT_RF_News.ipynb is the Analyze_fake_news_stories.csv and Analyze_CNN_stories.csv
You can find the output data "Analyze_CNN_stories.csv" here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/17CBbky2yICDsozz_sYPU6Jli3-SEgM9l/view?usp=sharing
